<br />

I aim to reach this following goals for this project:

1.  **Continuous learning** through hands-on implementation.
2. **Building my DevOps portfolio** with real-world examples.
3. **Creating basic CI/CD pipelines** to gain practical experience.

# Flow
---

âž¥ **Multi-Instance Architecture:** I'll be utilizing three EC2 instances to create a dedicated environment for development, Jenkins (Master & Slave), and a separate Flask application server.  <br />

âž¥ **Automated Source Code Fetch:** The pipeline will automatically fetch the latest source code from the version control system upon triggering through a webhook. <br />

 âž¥ **Versioned Image Builds:** I'll build Docker images for both the Flaskapp application and the database, ensuring version control and easy deployment. These images will be uploaded to a container registry for storage and retrieval. <br />

âž¥ **Streamlined Deployment:** The pipeline will seamlessly pull the required images from the registry and deploy them onto the development server, streamlining the deployment process. <br />

 âž¥ **Developer Notifications:** Once the deployment is complete, the pipeline will notify developers to review the updated application on the development server. <br />

âž¥ **Proactive Monitoring:** To ensure application health and optimize resource utilization, I'll set up CloudWatch notifications for health checks, billing alerts, and resource usage monitoring. <br />

# Feedback

**Iâ€™ve been teaching myself DevOps for over a semester, and now Iâ€™ve made my first CI/CD project. I know itâ€™s probably not perfectâ€”I mightâ€™ve messed up the flow or missed better ways to do things. If youâ€™ve got any feedback, [drop it here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHPjiyGjCactEcK1N34bO1gZvzv2AllK8AgA_AFSKMxHfOLg/viewform?usp=sharing) . Iâ€™d really appreciate it!**
